# Circuit Explanation

The Arduino acts as the main controller of the system.

The HC-05 Bluetooth module communicates via UART protocol. 
Since Arduino TX outputs 5V logic and HC-05 RX accepts 3.3V logic, a voltage divider (1kΩ and 2kΩ resistors) is used.

The relay module acts as an electrically isolated switch to control high-voltage AC loads safely.

This design ensures:
- Electrical isolation
- User safety
- Reliable wireless control
