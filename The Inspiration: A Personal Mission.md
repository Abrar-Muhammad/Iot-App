## 🕯️ The Inspiration: A Personal Mission

The "Diigital Home" project was not born in a lab, but from a personal experience during my childhood.

Growing up, I watched my **grandmother** struggle with mobility due to disability. For her, simple tasks that we take for granted—like getting up to turn off a light or adjusting a fan—were daily challenges. She often had to wait for someone else to assist her, losing a bit of her independence in the process.

Sadly, she passed away before I had the technical skills to help her. I built this project in her memory. 

I wanted to ensure that other elderly individuals and people with disabilities never have to wait for someone else to feel comfortable in their own homes. This project is my way of using technology to provide the independence and dignity that my grandmother deserved.
