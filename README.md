## 📖 About the Project
This app was created to demonstrate how mobile interfaces can interact with physical IoT devices. It features controls for home appliances (like fans and lighting) and uses Bluetooth connectivity to bridge the gap between the user and the hardware.

## 🚀 How to Open This Project
This is an open-source **MIT App Inventor** project. To view the blocks and logic:

1. **Download**: Get the `Diigital_Home.aia` file from this repository.
2. **Import**: 
   - Open [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/).
   - Click `Projects` > `Import project (.aia) from my computer`.
3. **Explore**: You can now view the Designer (UI) and the Blocks (Logic).
